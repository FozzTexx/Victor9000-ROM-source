                            NOTES
----------------------------------------------------------------
This is the diskette which contains all files and information
necessary to generate the Universal Boot ROMs to be used on the
Victor 9000 and NetWork Station CPU's.

Release 3.4 is enhanced over 3.3 by correcting the bug in the
non-fatal diagnostic checks which reset the mask registers
instead of the interrupt registers, and fixing the problem with
loading an O/S in an 896K system.

Release 3.5 has a bug fixed.  When booting on a 2-floppy system,
if you booted from drive B:, you could not access drive A:. This
was a BIOS bug, but was fixed in the EPROM by ensuring that the
stepper stage was set on both drives before the O/S took over.

Release 3.6 changes network boot file server socket numbers from
A0hex and B0hex to 80hex and B0hex; corrects the flashing screen
when you first push the reset button; and corrects a bug in non-
fatal error diagnostics which would occasionally report an error
when a rampant program wrote over some I/O registers and you
next booted (it would be corrected at next power-on).
